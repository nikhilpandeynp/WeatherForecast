Improvements than can be made with more time: - 

UI can be made better
We can add feature of fetching location based on IP address
We can provide more detailed weather forecast (chances of rain, humidity etc.)
We can provide an option to select the temperature unit (Celsius is the default now)
Improve on unit testing coverage
